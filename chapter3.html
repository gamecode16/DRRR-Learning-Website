                <h2>Volcano-Related Hazards</h2>
                <p>Preparing for a volcanic eruption requires specific considerations due to the unique hazards associated with it, such as ash fall, pyroclastic flow, ballistic projectiles, etc. It is also imporpant to know the signs of impending volcanic eruptions, as well as the paramaters used for monitoring volcanoes. </p>

                <h2>Volcano Hazards</h2>
                <p>Here are the hazards volcanic eruptions poses.</p>
                <div class="flex">
                    <div class="pic"><h5 class="two">Lahar</h5>
                        <p class="center"><b>Lahar</b> a Javanese term (Java is an island in Indonesia) that describes a hot or cold mixture of water and rock fragments that flows down the slopes of a volcano and typically enters a river valley.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="pic"><h5 class="two">Ash Fall</h5>
                        <p class="center">Volcanic ash, tiny rock and glass particles, poses health, aviation, electronics, and power generation hazards. It can be carried by wind thousands of miles, affecting more people.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="pic"><h5 class="two">Pyroclastic Flow</h5>
                        <p class="center"><b>Pyroclastic flow</b> are high-density mixtures of hot lava blocks, pumice, ashes, and volcanic gases, moving rapidly down volcanic slopes, typically following valleys.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="pic"><h5 class="two">Ballistic Projectiles</h5>
                        <p class="center">Rocks that an erupting volcano may hurl into the air. These blocks and bombs travel like cannonballs and usually land within 2km of the vent (but can travel as far as 5km, or even further, if the eruption is very explosive.)</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="pic"><h5 class="two">Volcanic Gases</h5>
                        <p class="center">Magma, containing dissolved gases, is the driving force behind volcanic eruptions, as it rises and pressure decreases, gases are released from the magma's liquid portion.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="pic"><h5 class="two">Lava Flow</h5>
                        <p class="center"><b>Lava flow</b> refers to molten rock erupting from a vent, varying in speed depending on factors like type, viscosity, ground steepness, flow form (sheet, channel, tube), and lava production rate at the vent.</p>

                <h2>The Parameter Used To Monitor Volcanic Activity</h2>
                <p>Here are the parameters used for monitoring volcanic activity:</p>
                <p>Ground deformation on volcanoes, such as sinking, tilting, and bulging, is often detected using tiltmeters and satellite imaging, but interpretation requires field verification.</p>
                <p>Seismic activity occurs when magma rises, breaking rock, generating earthquakes. Seismometers monitor quakes/tremors by determining seismic wave patterns before eruptions.</p>
                <p>Gases â€“ monitor types and rate of emission of different gases; Concentrations of gases are sometimes high enough to create acid rain that kills vegetation around the volcano; collection of samples from vents directly with the use of remote sensing instruments that identify and quantify the present gases.</p>
                <p>Sensory observations (by people living near volcano):</p>
                    <ul> 
                    <li>Visual  
                        <p>intensified presence of steam; drying up of vegetation, wells/spring/lake; crater glow at the mouth of the volcano.</p> 
                    </li>
                    <li>Auditory 
                        <p>rumbling sounds are heard.</p> 
                    </li>
                    <li>Olfactory 
                        <p>observed foul smell (usually rotten egg caused by sulfur) caused by presence of volcanic gases.</p> 
                    </li>    
                    <li>Tactile
