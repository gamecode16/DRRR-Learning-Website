                <h2>Emergency Preparedness</h2>
                <p>Being prepared can reduce fear, anxiety, and losses that accompany disasters. Communities, families, and individuals should know what to do in the event of a fire and where to seek shelter during a powerful storm.</p>
                <p>The best way to protect workers is to expect the unexpected and to carefully develop an emergency action plan to guide everyone in the workplace when immediate action is necessary. Planning in advance helps ensure that everyone knows what to do when an emergency occurs.</p>

                <h2>Include Common Emergency Scenarios When You Plan</h2>
                <h4>Plan for the emergencies that are most likely to happen where you live</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Be familiar with natural disaster risks in your community.</li>
                    <li>Consider how you will respond to emergencies that can happen anywhere, such as home fires and floods.</li>
                    <li>Consider how you will respond to emergencies that are unique to your region, such as volcanoes, tsunamis or tornadoes</li>
                    <li>Think about emergencies that may require your family to shelter in place (such as a winter storm), vs. emergencies that may require evacuation (such as a hurricane).</li>
                    <li>Consult our emergency resource library for tips on preparing for, responding to, and recovering from specific disasters.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Plan what to do in case you are separated during an emergency</h4>
                <p>Choose two places to meet up:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Right outside your home in case of a sudden emergency, such as a fire</li>
                    <li>Outside your neighborhood, in case you cannot return home or are asked to evacuate</li>
                    <li>Choose an out-of-area emergency contact person. It may be easier to text or call long distance if local phone lines are overloaded or out of service. Everyone should carry emergency contact information in writing and saved on their cell phones. Make sure places where your children spend time also have these contact numbers, like at school or daycare.</li>
                    <li>Your plan should account for family members who may live elsewhere during the year, such as members of the military on deployment or students away at college, or those who travel frequently.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Emergency Contact Card</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make cards for the whole family in case you are separated during an emergency.</li>
                </ul>
            </div><br/>
            <div class="ex">
                <h3>Plan what to do if you have to evacuate</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Decide where you would go and what route you would take to get there, such as hotel or motel.</li>
                <li>The home of friends or relatives a safe distance away.</li>
                <li>An evacuation shelter.</li>
                <li>Practice evacuating your home twice a year. Grab your emergency kit, just like you will in a real emergency, then drive your planned evacuation route. Plot alternate routes on your map in case roads are impassable. Make sure you have locations and maps saved on devices such as cell phones and GPS units and on paper.</li>
                <li>Plan ahead for your pets. Keep a phone list of pet-friendly hotels/motels and animal shelters that are along your evacuation routes. Remember, if it’s not safe for you to stay home, it’s not safe for your pets either.</li>
            </ul>
                <h3>Plan for everyone in your home</h3>

                <p>The Philippines, according to Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), is prone to tropical cyclones due to its geographical location which generally produce heavy rains and flooding of large areas and also strong winds which result in heavy casualties to human life and destructions to crops and properties. Thus, it is of utmost importance to have sufficient knowledge on such maritime phenomena for beneficial purposes.</p>

                <h3>Heatwave Preparedness Plan</h3>
                <p>As global temperatures continue to rise, heatwaves are becoming increasingly frequent and severe. These extreme heat events can have serious health impacts, particularly for vulnerable populations such as the elderly, children, and those with chronic health conditions. Consequently, having a robust heatwave preparedness plan is crucial for ensuring individual and community safety.</p>
                <p>Here are the things you should do when experiencing heatwaves:</p>
                <div class="flex2">
                    <div class="pic4"><h5 class="two">Before Going Outside</h5>
                        <p class="center">Before going outside, make sure to stock up electrolyte-rich beverages and water to stay hydrated. Make sure to stay cool by staying in spaces with air conditioners or spaces with adequate ventilation, if you are indoors. Also make sure to stay hydrated, and plan outdoor activities for cooler times of the day, such as early in the morning or late evening.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="pic4"><h5 class="two">While Outside</h5>
                        <p class="center">While outside, avoid direct sunlight. Bring umbrella, or stay in shaded areas such as trees, buildings, etc. Wearing lightweight, light-colored, and loose-fitting clothing will help you stay cool. Keep yourself hydrated all the times, and avoid caffinated and alcoholic drinks. It will only increase dehydration to your body. Don't forget to check other people who may be vulnerable to heat-related illnesses such as heatstroke, heat exhaustion, etc.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="pic4"><h5 class="two">After Going Outside</h5>
                        <p class="center">Even if you're already inside your house, or any establishments, be sure to keep yourself hydrated. Be aware of the symptoms of heat-related illnesses from yourself and the people around you. Seek medical assistance if needed. Learn from your experience to make adjustments to your plan in the future. Keep yourself informed to weather patterns to be prepared to future heatwaves.</p>
